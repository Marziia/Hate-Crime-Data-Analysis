abstract: "Upon studying the history of reported hate crimes in Toronto, we observe that there has been a sharp spike in 2023. We also observe that most of the hate crimes happen during the day, i.e. in broad daylight. Finally, we see that while most of the crims are reported almost instantaneously, there are some that take up to a day to repor."

# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....

# Data {#sec-data}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
library(opendatatoronto)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
nameOfDataSet <- "hate-crimes-open-data"
#### Download data ####
package <- show_package(nameOfDataSet)

# get all resources for this package
resources <- list_package_resources(nameOfDataSet)

# identify datastore resources; by default, Toronto Open Data sets datastore resource format to CSV for non-geospatial and GeoJSON for geospatial resources

datastore_resources <- filter(resources, tolower(format) %in% c('csv', 'geojson'))

# load the first datastore resource as a sample
data <- filter(datastore_resources, row_number()==1) %>% get_resource()

# first, we analyze if the number of crimes have increased over the years

# Convert the string years to integers
years_numeric <- as.integer(data$REPORTED_YEAR)

# Create a histogram of the years
hist(years_numeric, breaks = 7, col = "lightgrey", 
     main = "Histogram of Years",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Frequency")

# Looking at this, we can see that the trend was mostly non existent till 2022, and then in 2023, we had a spike in crimes.


```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is to show that the number of crimes has increased over the years. We use a linear regression model to prove this

## Model set-up

### Model justification

# Results

Our results are summarized in

```{r}
data$OCCURRENCE_YEAR <- as.integer(data$OCCURRENCE_YEAR)
frequency_table <- table(data$OCCURRENCE_YEAR)
print(frequency_table)

```

```{r}
frequency_df <- as.data.frame(frequency_table)
colnames(frequency_df) <- c("Year_of_hate_crime", "frequency")
frequency_df$Year_of_hate_crime <- as.numeric(as.character(frequency_df$Year_of_hate_crime))
# Fit the linear regression model
model <- lm(frequency ~ Year_of_hate_crime, data = frequency_df)

# Print the summary of the model
summary(model)
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(frequency_df, aes(x = Year_of_hate_crime, y = frequency)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression of Frequency vs Year of Hate Crime",
       x = "Year of Hate crime",
       y = "Frequency")
```
